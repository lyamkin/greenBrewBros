1. About us
We are are Green Brew Bros.We are a small microbrewery established in 2018 in the great
province of Nova Scotia. Two brothers, Simon and Samuel, and a love of ales is how our story
begins. Our beers are all organic and have a very earthy feel. Our bottles are all eco-friendly, reusable
and biodegradable. The most important thing for us is so make beer while keeping
mother earth happy.
2. What we expect
We expect to attract more of the millennial crowds who love the environment. We would like
our website to showcase our beers as well as our eco-friendliness. We are just starting out so
we have no sponsors, but would love to show off our trade show circuit this winter, big images
on our homepage about those 4 shows.
3. Content
We want out home page to showcase our trade show and environmental consciousness. We
also want to have a form so people can contact us and a list of all out beers and everything
they have to offer. If we could also have our event listed, since most of our business is from our
trade shows, it would be great to list those.
We also have images if you wanted to use some on your site.
4. External Data
We use a lot of social media: Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Instagram, Vimeo
